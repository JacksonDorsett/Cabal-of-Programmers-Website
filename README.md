#### About us

The Cabal of Programmers is a **grassroots, homegrown software engineering** ***and*** **computer science server** where students from all walks of life come together and **work on a variety of projects as a team.** 

There are three main projects that the server is currently working on:

1. The **Nail programming language** (written in **Rust**)
1. The **Cabal of Programmers Website** (Written using the **C# Blazor WASM Framework**)
1. A **Distributed recipe scraper** (Written in **multiple languages** using a **microservice architecture**)

The Cabal of programmers will be **hosting a 3 day hackathon from June 11th - June 13th.** There will be more information on our website coming soon!

All are welcome no matter the skill level.
